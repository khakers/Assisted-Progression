# Assisted Progression
Over the years and across various mods, there are ideas for blocks and items that don't fit some overall theme, but are still nice to have. This mod is a repository of sorts for those ideas. While every idea may not be completly novel, there are plenty of simple to use items and blocks that assist along the way in modded minecraft.

The Spawner relocator allows you to grab a vanilla spawner, and move it somewhere else. Hold right click and release when fully pulled to pickup, and the same in reverse to place it back down. This is one use, after placing the spawner the item will be consumed.
